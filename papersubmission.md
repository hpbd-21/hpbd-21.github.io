# Submission guidelines

* Papers must be written in English and should be no longer than 6 pages, excluding references, following the [IEEE two-column](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html) format for conference proceedings. Authors are requested to first register their submissions and then submit their manuscripts in PDF format at the [Easychair page](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hpbd21).

* Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. I.e., no names, addresses and affiliations should appear in the paper and any references to their own related work should be in the third person. The conference's double blind review process should avoid bias, yet nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the PC chairs by email.

* If you have any question regarding paper submission, please do not hesitate to contact the conference PC Chairs: <a href="mailto:jtpaulo@inesctec.pt,rtevans@tacc.utexas.edu">Jo√£o Paulo and Todd Evans</a>
