**All times are in Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) = UTC - 4**

**09:30AM - 9:40AM** -- Welcome and opening

**09:40AM - 10:20AM** -- *Are supercomputer centers ready for the big data era?*, Invited talk by Si Liu, TACC

As of 2021, the big data explosion continues, and the best supercomputers in the world are close to the exascale. Many applications on supercomputers deploy machine learning models and involve a huge amount of data nowadays. This generates enormous opportunities and challenges to supercomputer users, as well as supercomputer administrators and supporters. In this presentation, we will talk about the work and experience of the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC). Particularly, we will demonstrate 1) how we configured and managed TACC’s supercomputer systems to satisfy different scientific requirements and support various software stacks; 2) how we prepared multiple storage systems for diverse data usage and I/O work; 3) how we developed new tools and workflows for maintaining various user environments, bundling jobs, and improving I/O performance; and 4) how we designed new training programs and materials for staff and users.
